# UMDSTATS

This Google Chrome extension uses the PlanetTerp API to request information about a professor and then display the info on the UMD Schedule of Classes page.
The average rating of the professor is shown along with a hyperlink to reviews of the professor, if they exist on PlanetTerp. In addition, the average GPA of a 
course, with no regard to any professor, is shown.  

The following is a link to the extension on the Google Web Store. (If it's not here, we are currently waiting for it to be accepted.)  

Below you can find some pictures of the extension in action!
